Loop Knight is a game  in which the player controls a knight (from a top down view) who at first wields a basic sword.
The player has to fend off waves of increasingly more powerful monsters. The idea of scale comes
into play with the waves of monsters scaling in difficutly. Killing "Boss" enemy has the chance to 
drop a more powerful weapon or a potion to heal the player. The game ends when the player loses all 
of their health. Stronger enemies will deal more damage to add to the difficulty curve. By the end
I want the game to have varrying arenas for the player to fight in from wave to wave of enemies.
I would also like to add ranged attack options like bows, spears, and crossbows. In a perfect version
of this game, I would make sprites for the characters, but I am not sure if that is possible. I would like
to add random generation to the environments such as random obstacles.

Phase 1
[X] The Knight exists in the world as a placeholder emoji

[X] The Knight can move in all directions (wasd: up, left, down, right)

[X] The player has a healthbar of 5 hearts

[X] The boundaries of the screen prevent the knight from leaving

[X] The monsters spawn in at random rates until the first wave reaches the max capacity

Phase 2
[ ] The player can press a key (probably space) to make a sword appear and disappear in front of them (attack)

[ ] The player can interact with the monsters by attacking which makes them vanish when collided with a weapon

[ ] Once all enemies are dead the next wave begins after 5 seconds

[ ] The monsters take away one hit point from the player when running into the player

[ ] If the player loses all HP the game ends

Phase 3
[ ] Different monsters are made (ranged, melee)

[ ] Boss monsters are made 

[ ] Different weapons are made that bosses drop

[ ] Health Potions drop from bosses

[ ] The waves max capacity scale larger exponenctially each wave

[ ] Game sprites are made

[ ] Random arena environment generation
